You are welcome to Linquip ReactJS challenge 

We have a component called DynamicList which is responsible:
To take some titles and render them dynamically.
User is able to remove each added item.
Finally, user can send entered titles to server using an api Call.

The main structure of them app is implemented. and wee need you to:
- Take data from the Form component and add it to the list
- Render the list from added items (currently showing items are hard-coded)
- Implement Remove button functionality
- Send data to the server by clicking on "Send to Server" button
- After sending data to server using (), show successful message for 2 seconds 

Attentions:
- Don't rename, add or remove props of defined components.
- Don't add or remove any file
- All components should use pore-defined context (DynamicListContext) to handle the list state.
- The scope of this task is /src/components/DynamicList directory
- Assume that saveContacts() is an api call which sends given list to the server

You can use `npm install` and `npm start` to run the project on port 3000
